a music community webapp with timetabling running on backbone with a mongo/express backend

## getting your environment set up
1. install node
2. install mongodb
3. cd to project directory, ````npm install .````
4. ````node server````

## recompiling assets
i'm using stylus for css - if you make changes, you can compile them with something i'm going to write eventually here.
